# Lung Cancer Severity Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the severity of lung cancer in patients using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms, the project develops a robust predictive model to assist in the early detection and severity assessment of lung cancer.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing the dataset to identify patterns and correlations.
   - Analyzing distributions and relationships between variables.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Implementing multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assessing models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Comparing model performance to select the best model.
5. **Prediction**:
   - Using the best model to predict lung cancer severity in new patients.

## Code and Methodology
The code is organized in a Jupyter Notebook (`Projectfinal.ipynb`), which includes:
- **Importing Libraries**: Essential packages such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
- **Loading Data**: Reading the dataset into a DataFrame.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and prepare the data.
- **EDA**: Visualizations and insights derived from the data.
- **Modeling**: Building and training machine learning models.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics and model comparison.
- **Prediction**: Applying the best model to make predictions.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
